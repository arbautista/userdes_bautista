            <p>On the first week experience of the USERDES class, it was a bit of challenging but fun at the same time. I’d like the environment whenever Miss Jen was around because he can mingle with the students very well. On our lesson, my perspective on design had been change. I always thought that design is about how you apply your creativity on your specific object that you will design. But according to Steve Jobs, design is how it works. And for the process of design, I had some background of it but I only knew the understand the problem, develop, and improve. But based on our lesson you have to understand first the problem, make a research or observe about the case. Next is generate or look for possible solutions, then analyze, embody our solutions and lastly access or find the new problem. This process, I’ve used it to our activity 3.  </p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Reflection Paper No. 3</div>
            <p>On the 3rd week of User Design class, we were given a task to create a personal website using HTML and CSS. I have a little background about this because I have created an ecommerce website before when I was in Senior High School. That’s why I haven’t had a hard time working on this task.

            Github is one of the most popular git version control repository servers. I’ve also been using Github on our Mobile Programming subject and so far, as a student it is a perfect app to host a code. The codes are easy to track because of the commit changes. I’ve used 000webhost before, creating repositories limits only for 2, unlike Github. At first in Github, when I was new beginner at this, the function and purpose of the commit changes are a little bit of confusing but with the help of my classmates, I’ve been able to use it properly. Also, it makes a little harder to use because the there are no search button on repositories. I uploaded my website files and I want to search the index.html, but I needed to overlook it hand by hand. The Heroku app is fast are reliable, all I need to do is to connect my Github account and my chosen repositories. It is easy and reliable to deploy my website and clone my entire website. Overall, I love working with two apps because deploying my website makes me easier and faster.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Reflection No. 4</div>
            <p>At first, when there was announcement about the quiz, I though we were going to use moodle or LMS. But when Ms. Jen told us to open the userinyerface, I have no idea how to use this site or how it works. When I tried to explore it, it is very confusing, and it pisses me off as time pass by because I can’t even get out on the first level of the puzzle. But when I figured out the logic, I applied it to the succeeding level. And I finished it in 5mins which is not bad. I recommend this site with my friends and they hated this much because they can’t solve the puzzle. Overall, it is really the worst UI experiment I’ve ever encountered.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Activity No. 1</div>
            <p>Hi. I'm Alliah, most of my friends calls me Alliah. I was born and lived at Pasay City. I take Bachelor of Science in Information Technology - Specialized in Mobile and Internet Technology. I have joined different school organization, which includes the Junior Philippine Computer Society - APC Chapter. </p>
            <p>Music calms me down and relieves my stress. I usually listen to pop rock, electro pop rock, and indie music. This past few years, I attend gigs where I've met my gig buddies which is the 24k club. But lately, I am missing in action because of the schedules and my responsibilities at home. I spent my entire summer on training Muay Thai. At first, engaging to any kind sports helps me to be skinny, but I've learned that I train to be fit not to be skinny. I train insane and train to improve my self defense. At some point, I've also realized, that Muay Thai is not just a combat sport, but it also helps me to bring out the best of me. I've tried different kinds of sports, swimming, taekwondo, arnis, and boxing, but in Muay Thai, it feels like this is where I'm good at.</p>
            <p>We all know what rejection feels like. It hurts to the bone. But do not dwell on that feeling too much and instead, use it as a motivation to become someone or do something better. I've faced many rejections and only if I act on it, rejection will turn into acceptance or approval. </p>
            <p>I expect from this class that it would help me brings out my creativity when it comes to user design/ user interface. </p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">How would you design an interface for a 1000 floor elevator?</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3">Activity No. 3</div>
            <p>Designing a thousand floor for a certain building is pretty hard to design. Afterall, people’s safety is on my hand the moment they stepped in on the elevator or in the building. So, I would make sure the foundation of the building is strong enough to handle a thousand floor building. Next is I would separate the elevator into half, that makes 500-500. I would separate certain categories. For example, the first 500 floors will be for food, medical, shops, while the rest of the floor is for the businesses only. I have separated the color of the elevator, the first 500 floor will be color silver while the 501th floor to 1000th is teal. I’ve also separated the going up and going down elevator, where it will lessen the people’s waiting time on the elevator.</p> 
            <p>In this way, the line for the users of elevator will lessen. Also, I would require 15,000 pounds for the capacity of the elevator.</p>
            <p>Inside the elevator, there will be two screens and two touch screens on both sides of the elevator’s door. The screen was located on top both sides, it will appear what floor you’re into, the capacity of it. While the touch screen contains the number 0-9, the backspace and the letter B and P. B stands for basement while P stands for Penthouse. It will also appear the inputter number and what number will you input. </p>
            <p>The travel time from 1st to 500th floor will be 7minutes without interruptions. I’ve went to Strata 2000 building which has a 28istorey, and out of curiosity experience the 17th floor and the travel time is only 21 seconds without interruptions. </p>
